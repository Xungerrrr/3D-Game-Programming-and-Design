RPG Character
Lylek Games

Thank you for purchasing this asset!

To get started you can find the ready-to use character prefabs in the Resources folder.
Both the rpgcharacter_skin, and rpgcharacter_armored prefabs are ready for use and set up
with basic movement.
	
In the dmeo, we use the rpgcharacter_skin prefab, and a method of instantiating and destroying
armors via script instead of toggling components on and off. However, if you wish to toggle
armors instead, we have included an "rpgcharacter_armored" prefab in each of the character's
Resources folder.

To use the existing customization options, please open the CharacterCreation demo scene in the
Scenes folder. From there, you can pick from the available options to customize your character,
and add your own scripts to load the character into your scene. You may also use the demo scene
to generate characters and store them as prefabs, with the use of the CombineSkinnedMeshes script.
For further information please adhere to the ReadmeCombineSkinnedMeshes file.

With the current movement setup, your characters may run around using WASD, and toggle between
walking and running by holding SHIFT. Press the Tab key to toggle between combat and standard
movement states. Use key numbers 1 through 8 to toggle emotes.

You can find all animations, and the AnimatorController, in the RPGCharacter/Animations folder.

**Please leave a rating and review! Even a small review may help immensely with prioritizing updates.**
(Assets with few and infrequent reviews/ratings tend to have less of a priority and my be late or miss-out on crucial compatibility updates, or even be depricated.)
Thank you! =)
